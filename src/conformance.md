# Conformance rules for UGRID Conventions v1.x

This information is intended to follow the practice established by the
[CF conformance pages][cf_conformance], as attached to the [CF conventions][cf_conventions].

In that spirit, this is likewise "intended to be a concise summary" of the
main convention, and "if there are any discrepancies ... the conventions document
is the ultimate authority."
 
Each reference statement is provided with a short code :
"Rxxx" for requirements and "Axxx" for advisory recommendations,
in the manner of the [Flake8 error and warning codes][flake8_codes], and the [PyCodeStyle ones][pycodestyle_codes].
<br>Future editions will maintain these reference numbers, but possibly add new ones.  They can be used as definitive
references by a conformance-checker utility. [^10]

**This version** is consistent with :

  * UGRID v1.0 
  * [CF version 1.11][cf_current_version]

## Preamble : terms and definitions
- A ***mesh variable*** is a variable with a `cf_role` attribute of `"mesh_topology"`. [^2]
- A ***varlist*** is a string attribute consisting of a space-separated list of variable names
    - these must be names of variables existing in the same dataset : this is implicit in all uses
- A ***coordinate attribute*** of a mesh is a varlist with one of the following names [^2] [^4]
    - `node_coordinates`
    - `edge_coordinates`
    - `face_coordinates`
- A ***connectivity attribute*** of a mesh is a varlist with one of the following names [^2] [^4]
    - `edge_node_connectivity`
    - `face_node_connectivity`
    - `face_edge_connectivity`
    - `edge_face_connectivity`
    - `face_face_connectivity`
    - `boundary_node_connectivity`
- A ***mesh coordinate*** is a variable listed in a coordinate attribute of a mesh
- A ***mesh connectivity*** is a variable listed in a connectivity attribute of a mesh [^2]
- A mesh is the ***parent mesh*** of those mesh coordinates or mesh connectivities which are included in any of 
  its coordinate or connectivity attributes :
  This _defines_ the "parent mesh" of any mesh coordinate or mesh connectivity. [^1]
- The ***parent mesh*** of a location index set is that named in its `mesh` attribute
- the ***element dimensions*** of a mesh are those indexing its elements (i.e. nodes, edges or faces),
  or mesh boundaries, within any of its mesh coordinates and mesh connectivities.
    - the **node** dimension is the single dimension of the node coordinates (should all be the same)
    - if there is an `edge_node_connectivity`, then there is an **edge** dimension
      (see [below](#edge-dimension) for how this is determined)
    - if there is a `face_node_connectivity`, then there is a **face** dimension
      (see [below](#face-dimension) for how this is determined)
    - if there is a `boundary_node_connectivity`, then there is a **boundary** dimension
      (see [below](#boundary-dimension) for how this is determined)
- the ***element dimension*** of a mesh connectivity or mesh coordinate is that one of its dimensions
  which is an element dimension of its parent mesh.
  N.B. there can only be one : see [R201](#R201) / [R304](#R304)
- A ***location index set*** is a variable with a `cf_role` attribute of `"location_index_set"` [^2]
- A ***mesh data variable*** is a CF data variable with either a `mesh` or a `location_index_set` attribute.

## Location index set variables

      of its parent mesh [^3] [^8]
- <a id="A407" href="#A407">A407</a> any `start_index` attribute should have an integer type


## Mesh data variables
### Mesh data variable requirements
- if there is a `mesh` attribute
    - <a id="R501" href="#R501">R501</a> there must be no `location_index_set` attribute
    - <a id="R502" href="#R502">R502</a> the `mesh` must be the name of a valid mesh variable in the dataset
    - <a id="R503" href="#R503">R503</a> there must be a `location` attribute,
        - <a id="R504" href="#R504">R504</a> which is one of `face`, `edge` or `node`, and

- if there is a `location_index_set` attribute
    - <a id="R506" href="#R506">R506</a> there must be no `mesh` attribute
    - <a id="R507" href="#R507">R507</a> there must be no `location` attribute
    - <a id="R508" href="#R508">R508</a> the `location_index_set` must name a valid location index set variable in the dataset
- its dimensions ..
    - <a id="R509" href="#R509">R509</a> must contain one and only one mesh element dimension, which
    - <a id="R510" href="#R510">R510</a> is the appropriate element dimension of its mesh and location,
      as given by it's own `mesh` and `location` properties, or by those of its `location_index_set`


## Other
### Other recommendations

- <a id="A901" href="#A901">A901</a> all dataset contents (dimension, variables and their attributes) should also be
  CF compliant -- see: [CF conventions][cf_conventions].
- <a id="A902" href="#A902">A902</a> there should be a global `Conventions` attribute,
    - <a id="A903" href="#A903">A903</a> which contains a string section of the form `UGRID-<X.Y>`,
      where "<X.Y\>" is an appropriate release version of the UGRID conventions. [^9]
- <a id="A904" href="#A904">A904</a> no netcdf variable should have a `cf_role` equal to any of the values defined here,
  unless it is one of the UGRID variable types defined here to use one
  <br>-- i.e. a mesh, location index set or connectivity variable
- <a id="A905" href="#A905">A905</a> no dataset variable should have a `cf_role` which is not _either_
  one of the valid terms described here, _or_ one of the CF-defined `cf_role` values [^14]


[^1]: From the given definitions, any mesh connectivity or -coordinate must logically _have_ a
parent mesh.  We *intend* that it should always have exactly and only one.

[^2]: for correctness testing (only), we may broaden the definitions of these items in order to detect some obvious
errors.  For example, we will attempt to check as a mesh variable any variable that _either_ has a `cf_role` of `mesh_topology`
_or_ is named in the `mesh` attribute of a data variable or location index set variable.

[^3]: "valid" element indices are values within the range of the corresponding element dimension of the parent mesh,
allowing for any `start_index` offset.

[^4]: For now at least, we _exclude_ mention of full-3d meshes, whose status is currently in question : 
cf. [this GitHub discussion][volume_status], as this would add considerable complexity here.

[^5]: For now, we _allow_ 0-d meshes (those with nodes only).  Though, this is not explicitly mentioned in the UGRID v1.0 pages.

[^6]: It is not supported to have boundaries in a 1-D mesh (I.E. one with only edges), though this is not logically
impossible.  If a specific need arises, this could change in future.

[^7]: Since there is no provision for a `boundary_dimension` attribute, the boundary dimension is always the
_first_ dimension of a `boundary_node_connectivity`, and its second dimension must always be 2
(i.e. it cannot be transposed).  If a specific need arises, this could change in future.

[^8]: Requirements on _values_ of variables may not always be practical to check,
since this requires loading all of their data.

[^9]: The form of the global `Conventions` attribute is determined by the [CF conformance pages][cf_conformance],
section 2.6.1.  However, the definition of UGRID release numbers is not yet finalised.

[^10]: Providing stable statement references allows conformance statements to evolve without invalidating earlier
versions of a checker program.  We also provide a linkable web anchor for each one.

[^11]: if a mesh does not share any element dimensions with other meshes, it follows that it also will not share any
  element coordinates or connectivities with other meshes.

[^12]: invalid 'lookalike' attributes, which are not defined by UGRID, include such as :
  "node_face_connectivity", "boundary_coordinates", "boundary_dimension" or "node_dimension".

[^13]: for checking purposes, the identity of a connectivity is actually defined by the referring attribute in the parent mesh.
   However, if the connectivity is correctly formed, then its `cf_role` value will always be the same as this  -- cf:[R303](#R303).

[^14]: in the present [latest CF version][cf_current_version] the only `cf_role` terms defined are the discrete-geometry
  types : `timeseries_id`, `profile_id` and `trajectory_id`
